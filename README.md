## About me
After 4 years working in an IT support role, starting as a Junior Technician and working my way up to become a Network Manager for a secondary school, I started exploring new career options. I wanted to have a career where I had opportunities to be creative, learn new skills, work collaboratively, and to have control over my time and location. 

Software/ Web Development immediately stood out as a great option, I love the combination of technicality and creativity, as well as the options for remote work. Something that I've also grown to love is being able to create something from just a simple idea, and seeing it come to fruition.
